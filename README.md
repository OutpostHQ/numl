**NUDE Elements** is a mix of four concepts: 

* **Language** - Alternative markup language for the modern web that meant to be a partial HTML/CSS replacement to describe complex responsive interfaces and dynamic relations between elements without frustration but with fun and highest compatibility with other modern technologies.
* **Methodology** - Simple and intuitive methodology to ensure your apps look and work great. It eliminates some confusing conceptions as "margins" and brings clarity and order to your markup.
* **Framework** - Powerful next-generation JS-Powered CSS-Framework based on Custom Elements that solves many fundamental problems like element inheritance, efficient runtime CSS-generation, theme color generation, sane id linking and affordable accessibility.
* **Library** - Highly-customizable built-in components to ensure you have everything to start creating handy components and wonderful accessible interfaces with responsiveness.

**UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT, API is subject to change**

## FAQ

**Q: Why should I use NUDE instead of popular CSS-framework like Tailwind?**

**A:** Popular CSS-frameworks tend to decide what you need and provide tools that limit the power of CSS. Unlike them, NUDE unleashes the power of CSS by making it dynamic and parametrizable without the need to use a preprocessor.

**Q: Why should I use NUDE instead of writing CSS from the scratch?**

**A:** CSS is complex but the modern web is not possible without it. Instead of replacing CSS, NUDE simplifies every aspect of CSS development by providing handy abstractions for responsiveness, theming, complex selectors, etc. It provides reasonable defaults leaving you with ability to change them if you need it. It greatly reduces amount of work that needed to be done not only for developers but for designers too!

**Q: I am a web designer. How can NUDE help me?**

**A:** Many web designers learn CSS frameworks these days. So it’s a good choice to try. NUDE is much more flexible and easy to learn than other powerful alternatives. For example it do a lot of color magic by generating and adapting them for various purposes. Also it can help you to learn more about modern best practices and accessibility features of the web which we think is very important. 

**Q: How can I use NUDE with older browsers?**

**A:** NUDE substantially depends on Custom Elements and Custom Properties. The CE can be easily polyfilled back to IE11 but CP can’t. While NUDE methodology don’t strictly require CP, they makes NUDE implementation much easier and faster in performance. See details in the related [ISSUE](https://github.com/tenphi/nude/issues/2).

**Q: Is NUDE SEO-friendly?**

**A:** NUDE’s focus is to provide a language for creating accessible and beautiful interfaces. SEO is a completely different task that often contradicts to best practices and accessibility. We believe such task can be achieved separately by using preprocessors and other technics without touching NUDE philosophy.

**Q: Is NUDE production-ready?**

**A:** It's NOT despite the fact it's widely used in production by the Author of NUDE. And he is working hard to make it production-ready for everyone as soon as possible but without community support it will be a long run. So give it a try, leave some feedback, post issues and tell friends to support our project!

## Usage
Add `numl.js` to your page and initialize it.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/numl/dist/numl.js"></script>
```

And that's all! Now your application is **NUDE-ready**!

Try to write some HTML to build awesome interfaces.

```html
<nu-card
  display="flex"
  width="clamp(320px, 100%, initial)"
  responsive="480px"
  labelledby="heading"
  describedby="description price"
  gap="1" flow="row|column" items="start|initial">
  <nu-icon name="package" size="4" place="start"></nu-icon>
  <nu-flow gap=".5" grow="1">
    <nu-heading level="3" id="heading">Product name</nu-heading>
    <nu-line></nu-line>
    <nu-block id="description">Very very long product description</nu-block>
    <nu-flex gap="1" items="center|start" flow="row|column-reverse">
      <nu-btn special>
        <nu-icon name="dollar-sign" inline></nu-icon>
        Order now
      </nu-btn>
      <nu-block mod="w6" color="special" size="lg|md" id="price" padding=".5x 1x">
        Only $99.99
      </nu-block>
    </nu-flex>
  </nu-flow>
</nu-card>
```

## Build

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating four files:

* `dist/numl.js` - IIFE-module with auto initialization. Elements' CSS included. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `dist/numl.module.js` - ES-module. Tree-shaking-friendly bundle. Elements' CSS included.
* `dist/numl.module.dev.js` - Same as above but with helpful warnings and without minification.

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.

## Local playground

Run `npm run play` to view test page with few examples.
