## FAQ

**Q: There are many CSS-Frameworks out there. Why is NUDE different?**

**A:** CSS-Frameworks solve problems related to styling while NUDE tend to solve many others related to interface creation like accessibility, color generation, style/logic sharing and context awareness. It's just more complex and ambitious. 

**Q: Why should I use NUDE instead of popular CSS-framework like Tailwind?**

**A:** Popular CSS-frameworks tend to decide what you need and provide tools that limit the power of CSS. Unlike them, NUDE unleashes the power of CSS by making it dynamic and parameterizable without the need to use a preprocessor.

**Q: Why should I use NUDE instead of writing CSS from the scratch?**

**A:** CSS is complex but the modern web is not possible without it. Instead of replacing CSS, NUDE simplifies every aspect of CSS development by providing handy abstractions for responsiveness, theming, complex selectors, etc. It provides reasonable defaults leaving you with ability to change them if you need it. It greatly reduces amount of work that needed to be done not only for developers but for designers too!

**Q: Why should I use NUDE instead of using CSS-in-JS approach?**

**A:** CSS-in-JS really simplifies some aspects of writing CSS. But it's still CSS. It's like you move your problems from one file to another. NUDE solves many problems by itself, providing you API to solve many others without stuffing your JS files. In fact, it greatly reduces them by providing useful declarations in markup. 

**Q: I am a web designer. How can NUDE help me?**

**A:** Many web designers learn CSS frameworks these days. So it’s a good choice to try. NUDE is much more flexible and easy to learn than other powerful alternatives. For example it do a lot of color magic by generating and adapting them for various purposes. Also it can help you to learn more about modern best practices and accessibility features of the web which we think is very important. 

**Q: How can I use NUDE with older browsers?**

**A:** NUDE substantially depends on Custom Elements and Custom Properties. The CE can be easily polyfilled back to IE11 but CP can’t. While NUDE methodology don’t strictly require CP, they makes NUDE implementation much easier and faster in performance. See details in the related [ISSUE](https://github.com/tenphi/nude/issues/2).

**Q: Is NUDE SEO-friendly?**

**A:** NUDE’s focus is to provide a language for creating accessible and beautiful interfaces. SEO is a completely different task that often contradicts to best practices and accessibility. We believe such task can be achieved separately by using preprocessors and other technics without touching NUDE philosophy.

**Q: Is NUDE production-ready?**

**A:** It's NOT despite the fact it's widely used in production by the Author of NUDE. And he is working hard to make it production-ready for everyone as soon as possible but without community support it will be a long run. So give it a try, leave some feedback, post issues and tell friends to support our project!
