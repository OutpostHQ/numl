**Numl** is a markup and style language to create modern **high-quality** web-interfaces with any look using HTML-based syntax. It utilizes the power of Web Components and creates all the CSS needed right in runtime as it requires, which makes it much more flexible than any other styling solution. Built-in elements will allow you to make gorgeous interfaces and accessible components without inventing your own Design System or UI library.

**PRE-BETA VERSION, UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT**

**Numl** is:

* Customizable **Design System** for any project and scale
* Accessible production-ready **Prototyping Solution**
* Handy **UI library** for your favorite framework
* Powerful **CSS/JS/HTML-Framework** with CSS generation, inheritance and more
* Markup **Methodology** that is enjoyable to follow
* All-in-one **Language** to describe interfaces that look and work great

And also... it's **just a single js-file** that you can include into your website to start doing magic:

* **No** build step needed (*don't wait! create!*)
* **No** config needed (*your markup is your config*)
* **No** scripting to activate
* **No** confusing classes to style
* **No** frustration in usage

With **Numl** you can:

* Create virtually **any interface** you want
* Make your interface **accessible** without fighting IDs and specifications
* Create your own element or a whole **Design System** with ease
* **Responsive layouts** with effort so little you've never seen before
* **Copy-paste** your markup from project to project, regardless of the framework used
* Add **Dark** and **High-contrast** modes to your site effortlessly
* Be calm for technical debt in markup code
* **Enjoy** while doing what you love

* [Before/After slider](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/before-after-slider)
* [Login form validation](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/login-form)

## Getting started

To start prototyping with **Numl** just add a single module to the page:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/numl@0.11/dist/index.js"></script>
```

That's it! No build step, no explicit function call to apply changes.

If you want to prevent flash of unstyled content then add the following tag to the `head`:

```html
<style>nu-root { opacity: 0; }</style>
```

Make sure you are using `nu-root` tags on the top-level of your app:

```html
<body>
  <nu-root>
    <nu-card>
      My first <nu-mark>Numl</nu-mark> application!
    </nu-card>
  </nu-root>
</body>
```

Now it's time to have fun!... Try to write some HTML and build awesome interfaces.

### NPM installation

Numl is also available via npm.
```bash

## Build

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating four files:

* `dist/index.js` - ES6 tree-shaking friendly module. (Exports global `Nude` object)

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change.

## Local playground

Run `npm start` to view test page with few examples.

## Roadmap

* Documentation
* More examples
* TRL Support
