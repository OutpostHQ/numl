**Numl** An open-source Library of Web Components and a Runtime CSS Framework for rapidly building UI that follows your Design System.

- **For beginners** Use a well-thought-out Design System with automatic Dark Scheme and High Contrast Mode for rapid developing adaptive and accessible UIs. Create new components by nesting or/and styling foundation elements. 
- **For enthusiastic** Customize the Numl Design System to the smallest detail in runtime using HTML. Use behaviors and control system to add simple interactions. Add your favorite framework (**Vue.js**, **Angular**, **React**, **Svelte**...) for complex logic.
- **For experts** Use JavaScript API to create elements that follow your Design System on top of the **Numl**. Integrate Design Tokens into elements to have more control. Add your own unique elements, styles, and behaviors.

## Examples

* [Flex playground](https://numl.design/storybook/layouts/flex-playground)
* [Grid playground](https://numl.design/storybook/layouts/grid-playground)
* [Markdown converter](https://numl.design/storybook/converters/markdown)
* [Before/After slider](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/before-after-slider)
* [Login form validation](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/login-form)

## Getting started

To start prototyping with **Numl** just add a single module to the page:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.skypack.dev/numl@0.12"></script>
```

That's it! No build step, no explicit function call to apply changes.

If you want to prevent flash of unstyled content then add the following tag to the `head`:

```html
:not(:defined) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Make sure you are using `nu-root` tags on the top-level of your app:

```html
<body>
  <nu-root>
    <nu-card>
      My first <nu-mark>Numl</nu-mark> application!
    </nu-card>
  </nu-root>
</body>
```

Now it's time to have fun!... Try to write some HTML and build awesome interfaces.

[Check out the Guide](https://numl.design/guide/basics/base-syntax) (Work in progress)

### NPM installation

Numl is also available via npm.
```bash
$ npm install numl --save
```

Import the module to your application:
```javascript
import 'numl';
```

Make sure that **Numl** won't be run on the server side.

**Numl** don't support SSR but still compatible with it, just make sure you import it after the app rehydration. You can use dynamic import for this:

```javascript
import('numl');
```
